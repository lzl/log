Do you have a life? Log it for the future version of yourself.

# Why?

Why I build this Meteor app? 1st, I have learned Meteor for a while, I need a tiny project to evaluate what I have learned. 2nd, I have a blog for a long time, I used to tweet a few words, but I need a sandbox to log what I am doing, what I have learned and how is the projects going on. This app is my answer to mine. I will use it daily and I hope it will be enjoyable, to me and some of you.

# Layout

'git checkout step1-layout'

Thinking is like a stream of river flows out of your head. When you have something to log, just output it, without any barrier. When you output with your finger on the keyboard, the bytes print on the screen will and only will be what you're typing or its context.

Then, a place to log and a place to see the logs you have submited. That's all we need.
